I'm planning on making my own note taking app because I haven't been happy with any of the ones I've seen. If anyone wants to try it out once I have something to show, let me know! I'll post it in this channel.

What I've tried:

- Org-mode in Doom Emacs
- Folder with plain text notes, using my preferred text editor (`helix`)
- Obsidian notes
- logseq

Things I want in my notes app:

- Like in a file explorer, I shoud see the content of things, though unlike a file explorer it should not just be a preview
- Images and text are all displayed, no need to open a text file to view it
- Drag and drop notes into different folders
- Local-first/offline-first design: I should be in control of the data
- Data sync: will start by using Syncthing; stretch goal is to use something that deals with conflicts better

Non-goals:

- Every note being a regular file -- would like to have, but I want to prioritize formats that can deal with sync conflicts
- Reading PDFs and other such formats -- the notes app should be multimedia, but it should also be shorter pieces of content that you have digested; not someone else's science paper. Use a different app for reading later and capturing content
- TODO lists -- again, goal is not to be a task manager. Goal is to keep thoughts and summaries
